# Coordinate-Calculator-
This Project is to make a command line application which can determines the following: <br />
1. 2 dimensional Calculations <br />
  a.To determine the quadrants of the coordinate <br />
  b.To find the distance between 2 coordinates <br />
  c.To find the midpoint between 2 coordinates <br />
2. 3 dimensional Calculations <br />
  a.To determine the octants of the coordinate <br />
  b.To find the distance formula between 2 coordinates <br />
  c.To find the midpoint between 2 coordinates <br />
